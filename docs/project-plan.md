## ðŸŽ¯ Next Major Enhancement: Source Debugger (6 weeks)

### Overview
Transform Sentrypede from an error notification system into an intelligent source debugger that provides actionable, code-level guidance by analyzing actual source files.

**ðŸ“‹ Detailed Specification:** [Source Debugger PRD](./source-debugger-prd.md)

### Current Gap
While Sentrypede successfully provides high-level error analysis (80% confidence), engineers still receive generic guidance without specific, actionable fixes:
- Analysis mentions "error handling problems" but doesn't show exact code locations
- Recommendations are high-level without specific implementation details
- Engineers must manually correlate stack traces with codebases

### Target Outcome
**Reduce debugging time from 30+ minutes to <5 minutes** by providing:
- Exact error locations in source code with context
- Specific code fixes with line-by-line recommendations
- Before/after diffs with confidence scores and risk assessment
- Automated pull requests with comprehensive fix documentation

### Implementation Phases

#### Phase 9.1: Source File Integration (2 weeks) âœ… (Completed)
- [x] GitHub file retrieval system at specific commits
- [x] Stack trace parsing to extract file paths and line numbers
- [x] File caching mechanism for performance
- [x] Integration with existing Sentry error processing pipeline

#### Phase 9.2: Enhanced AI Analysis (2 weeks) 
- [x] Context-aware Gemini prompts with actual source code
- [ ] Multi-stage analysis: location â†’ root cause â†’ fix generation
- [ ] Code change suggestion framework with confidence scoring
- [ ] Risk assessment for proposed changes

#### Phase 9.3: Rich Slack Experience (1 week)
- [x] Syntax-highlighted code previews in Slack
- [ ] Interactive buttons for "Apply Fix", "Create PR", "Request Review"
- [ ] Expandable code context sections
- [ ] Before/after diff visualization

#### Phase 9.4: Automated Pull Requests (1 week)
- [ ] Smart PR creation with comprehensive templates
- [ ] Auto-assignment based on file ownership (CODEOWNERS)
- [ ] Enhanced PR descriptions with error analysis and rollback plans
- [ ] Integration with existing PR simulation mode

### Success Metrics
- **Developer Experience:** >85% fix accuracy, >70% adoption rate
- **Business Impact:** 50% MTTR reduction, 40% error recurrence reduction
- **Technical Performance:** <2 minute analysis time, 95% success rate

## Session Progress Log
- Reviewed existing codebase structure
- Found that basic Slack and Sentry services are already implemented
- Slack service has comprehensive functionality including thread management
- Sentry service uses auth token approach, needs OAuth implementation
- Configuration management is already set up
- Need to add OAuth flow for Sentry as requested

    - Handles commit SHA detection from Sentry events
    - Multi-file retrieval with graceful failure handling
- **Enhanced Integration:**
  - GitHub API integration extended for commit-specific file retrieval
  - Sentry error processing pipeline enhanced with source context

  - Automatic extraction of source files from stack traces
  - Performance-optimized file caching (50MB, 1000 files, 30min TTL)
  - Multi-language support with automatic detection
  - Commit-specific file retrieval for accurate error context
  - Graceful handling of missing files and API failures

## Notes
- Using TypeScript on Node.js as specified
- Focus on modular, testable architecture
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Security-first approach for API credentials
- OAuth implementation will provide better security and user experience
- The OAuth flow is optional - can still use direct auth tokens if preferred
- CI/CD pipeline ensures code quality and automated deployments
- **Phase 9.1 Source Debugger foundation successfully implemented** - ready for Phase 9.2 Enhanced AI Analysis
