# Sentrypede Project Plan

## Project Overview
Building an automated Slack agent that monitors Sentry for new errors, attempts to fix them using AI (Google Gemini), and creates pull requests for human review.

## Today's Goals (Current Session)
1. ✅ Create project structure and plan
2. [ ] Set up package.json with dependencies
3. [ ] Create configuration management system
4. [ ] Build Slack agent worker foundation
5. [ ] Implement Sentry monitoring
6. [ ] Write comprehensive unit tests
7. [ ] Test all components

## Notes
- Using TypeScript on Node.js as specified
- Focus on modular, testable architecture
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Security-first approach for API credentials
