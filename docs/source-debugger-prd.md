# Sentrypede Source Debugger PRD

## Overview

Enhance Sentrypede to provide actionable, code-level debugging guidance by analyzing Sentry errors against actual source files and suggesting specific code changes.

## Problem Statement

### Current State
Sentrypede successfully:
- Fetches Sentry errors with stack traces and metadata
- Uses Gemini AI to provide high-level error analysis (80% confidence)
- Posts analysis to Slack with professional threading
- Identifies general root causes and recommendations

### Gap Analysis
**Engineers receive generic guidance but lack specific, actionable fixes:**
- Analysis mentions "error handling problems" but doesn't show exact code locations
- Recommendations are high-level ("add try-catch blocks") without specific implementation
- No visibility into actual source code context where errors occur
- Engineers must manually correlate stack traces with codebases
- Time-consuming manual investigation required for each error

### Business Impact
- **Developer Productivity:** Engineers spend 60-80% of debugging time locating and understanding error context
- **Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR):** High MTTR due to investigation overhead
- **Error Recurrence:** Generic fixes often miss nuanced code-level issues
- **Team Efficiency:** Senior engineers pulled into debugging sessions for context

## Solution Overview

Transform Sentrypede into an intelligent source debugger that:
1. **Retrieves relevant source files** from the repository where errors occur
2. **Correlates stack traces** with exact code locations
3. **Analyzes error context** using actual source code + Sentry data
4. **Generates specific code fixes** with line-by-line recommendations
5. **Provides actionable pull requests** with implemented solutions

## Technical Requirements

### 1. Source File Retrieval System

#### GitHub Integration Enhancement
```typescript
interface SourceFileRetrieval {
  fetchFileAtCommit(repo: string, filePath: string, commitSha: string): Promise<string>
  fetchMultipleFiles(repo: string, filePaths: string[], commitSha: string): Promise<Map<string, string>>
  getRepositoryFromStackTrace(stackTrace: StackFrame[]): string
  resolveFilePathsFromStackTrace(stackTrace: StackFrame[]): string[]
}
```

#### Stack Trace Analysis
- Parse Sentry stack frames to extract:
  - Repository information
  - File paths relative to project root
  - Line numbers and column positions
  - Function/method names
- Handle different stack trace formats (Node.js, Python, Java, etc.)
- Resolve source maps for minified JavaScript

#### File Context Extraction
- Retrieve 20-50 lines around error location for context
- Fetch related files (imports, dependencies, test files)
- Support monorepo structures with multiple projects
- Handle private repositories with proper authentication

### 2. Enhanced AI Analysis Engine

#### Context-Aware Prompting
```typescript
interface SourceAnalysisRequest {
  sentryError: SentryIssue
  sourceFiles: Map<string, string>  // filepath -> content
  stackTrace: StackFrame[]
  errorContext: {
    lineNumber: number
    columnNumber: number
    functionName: string
    surroundingCode: string
  }
}
```

#### Multi-Stage Analysis
1. **Error Location Identification**
   - Pinpoint exact error location in source code
   - Identify contributing factors in surrounding code
   - Analyze data flow leading to error

2. **Root Cause Analysis**
   - Examine variable states and type mismatches
   - Identify missing error handling patterns
   - Detect race conditions or async/await issues
   - Analyze dependency interactions

3. **Fix Generation**
   - Generate specific code changes with line numbers
   - Provide multiple fix options (quick fix vs comprehensive)
   - Include test case suggestions
   - Consider performance and security implications

### 3. Intelligent Fix Recommendations

#### Code Change Suggestions
```typescript
interface CodeFixSuggestion {
  filePath: string
  changes: {
    startLine: number
    endLine: number
    originalCode: string
    suggestedCode: string
    rationale: string
  }[]
  confidence: number
  riskLevel: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high'
  testingGuidance: string
}
```

#### Fix Categories
- **Defensive Programming:** Add null checks, validation, error boundaries
- **Error Handling:** Try-catch blocks, promise rejection handling
- **Type Safety:** TypeScript type annotations, runtime type checking
- **Performance:** Memory leaks, infinite loops, inefficient algorithms
- **Security:** Input sanitization, authentication checks

### 4. Enhanced Slack Integration

#### Rich Code Previews
- Syntax-highlighted code blocks showing error location
- Before/after diffs for proposed changes
- Expandable sections for full file context
- Thread organization by severity and fix complexity

#### Interactive Elements
- Buttons for "Apply Fix", "Create PR", "Request Review"
- Reaction-based feedback for fix quality
- Link to GitHub file at specific line/commit

### 5. Automated Pull Request Generation

#### Smart PR Creation
```typescript
interface AutomatedPRConfig {
  branchNaming: string  // e.g., "sentrypede/fix-{issueId}"
  prTitle: string       // e.g., "Fix: {errorTitle} in {fileName}"
  prDescription: string // Include error analysis and fix rationale
  assignees: string[]   // Auto-assign based on file ownership
  labels: string[]      // e.g., ["bug", "sentrypede-fix", "needs-review"]
}
```

#### PR Content Structure
1. **Error Summary:** Sentry link, occurrence count, user impact
2. **Root Cause Analysis:** AI-generated technical explanation
3. **Fix Implementation:** Code changes with rationale
4. **Testing Guidance:** Suggested test cases and validation steps
5. **Rollback Plan:** How to revert if issues arise
